# RPL
RPL Pooled Lending (RPL) is a protocol for lending/borrowing RPL to stake on
Rocket Pool nodes.

No collateral asset is required to borrow RPL from lenders because the borrowed
RPL is immediately staked on a node, and the withdrawal address for the node is
verified to be a smart contract in the RPL protocol that will enforce the terms
of the loan.
